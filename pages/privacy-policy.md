# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2024-12-12_

This Privacy Policy describes how **Picobell** ("the App") handles user data.
The App is developed and maintained by **Jonas Fagnastøl Henriksen**.

The App requires Google Sign-In for authentication and uses the user's Google
account email address. No other personal information is collected or stored.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Google Account Information
When you sign in, the App receives your **Google email address** (and optionally
your display name, depending on your Google account settings).
This information is used **solely for authentication and identifying your
account** inside the App.

We do *not* access:

- contacts
- files
- calendar
- phone number
- Google Drive
- or any other Google profile data

### 1.2 User-Provided Address Label
The App allows you to optionally set a **label** (e.g., “Leilighet 2A” or
similar) to identify your doorbell/device. Initially a generic label is
provided, Picobell-xxxx.

This label:

- is provided by you
- is not validated or linked to your real home address
- is only used to help you identify your devices in the App

No other personal information is collected.

The App does **not** collect location data, analytics, device identifiers, or
tracking information.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information exclusively to:

- authenticate you via Google Sign-In
- associate your account with your doorbell/device
- display your chosen device label in the App

We do **not** use your data for:

- marketing
- profiling
- analytics
- advertising
- selling or sharing with third parties

Your data is never used beyond what is required to provide the App's core
functionality.

## 3. Data Storage

The following data may be stored securely on our server:

- your Google email address

We do not store passwords — authentication is handled entirely by Google.

We only send the minimal data needed to deliver notifications or messages to
